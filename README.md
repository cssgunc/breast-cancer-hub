## Project Overview - BCH Self Examination Reminder Mobile App

The Breast Cancer Hub is working on an inclusive, cross-platform breast cancer self-examination reminder app that will be deployed to underserved populations internationally. It is an offline app that will remind users, based on their entered demographic information, when they should perform an exam for breast cancer. It will provide a calendar for tracking exam dates and periods if any, push or in-app notifications when it is time to do a self-examination, and step-by-step guides for administering self exams.

The current state of the project is focused on API integration, adding functionality, session storage and authentication to the frontend views.

The app uses React Native (Expo) with Express.js middleware and a Neon (Postgre-SQL provider) backend.
